/*
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves breaking down a large, complex table into smaller, related tables.

In simple terms: It's the "clean-up" rulebook for your database to avoid storing the same information in multiple places.

Main Goal: To eliminate Anomalies (Insertion, Update, Deletion) we discussed earlier.

Normal Forms
Normalization is done in stages, called "Normal Forms." Each form has a set of rules the database must follow.

1. First Normal Form (1NF)
Rule: A table is in 1NF if:

All columns contain atomic (indivisible) values.

Each column has a single value per row (no lists or sets).

All entries in a column are of the same data type.

2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
Rule: A table is in 2NF if:

It is already in 1NF.

It has no partial dependencyâ€”meaning no non-prime attribute (an attribute not part of any candidate key) is dependent on only a part of the primary key.

In simple terms: If a table has a composite primary key (a key made of multiple columns), every other column must describe the full key, not just part of it.
