/*
What is an Object?

An object is a real-world entity that has state (data) and behavior (actions).

In Java, an object is created from a class.

Think of a class as a blueprint, and an object as a real thing built using that blueprint.

// Class is the blueprint
class Car {
    // State (attributes)
    String brand;
    String color;
    int speed;

    // Behavior (methods)
    void drive() {
        System.out.println(brand + " is driving at " + speed + " km/h");
    }

    void stop() {
        System.out.println(brand + " has stopped.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating objects (instances of Car)
        Car car1 = new Car();
        car1.brand = "BMW";
        car1.color = "Black";
        car1.speed = 120;

        Car car2 = new Car();
        car2.brand = "Tesla";
        car2.color = "Red";
        car2.speed = 150;

        // Using objects
        car1.drive(); // Output: BMW is driving at 120 km/h
        car2.drive(); // Output: Tesla is driving at 150 km/h
        car1.stop();  // Output: BMW has stopped.
    }
}


/*
Key Points:
1. Class = Blueprint (Car)
2. Object = Instance of class (car1, car2)
3. Attributes = Variables (brand, color, speed)
4. Methods = Actions (drive, stop)
