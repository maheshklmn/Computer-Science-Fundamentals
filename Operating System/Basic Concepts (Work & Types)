/*
An Operating System (OS) is system software that acts as an interface between the user and computer hardware. It manages hardware resources and provides services for application programs.

In simple terms: The OS is like a manager that coordinates all activities in a computer system and makes the hardware usable.

Main Work/Functions of an Operating System
1. Process Management
Creates, schedules, and terminates processes

Manages CPU time allocation

Handles process synchronization and communication

2. Memory Management
Allocates and deallocates memory space

Keeps track of which memory is being used

Implements virtual memory for efficient memory usage

3. File System Management
Creates, deletes, and organizes files

Manages directories and storage devices

Controls access permissions

4. Device Management
Controls all input/output devices

Manages device drivers

Handles device allocation and deallocation

5. Security and Protection
Implements user authentication

Controls access to resources

Prevents unauthorized access

Types of Operating Systems
1. Batch Operating System
Purpose: Processes similar jobs in batches

Example: Early mainframe systems

Use Case: Payroll processing, bank statements

2. Time-Sharing/Multitasking OS
Purpose: Multiple users share system resources

Example: UNIX, Linux

Use Case: Servers, multi-user environments

3. Real-Time OS (RTOS)
Purpose: Time-critical applications with strict deadlines

Example: VxWorks, QNX

Use Case: Air traffic control, medical systems, industrial automation

4. Distributed OS
Purpose: Manages a group of independent computers as a single system

Example: Hadoop Distributed File System

Use Case: Cloud computing, distributed databases

5. Network OS
Purpose: Manages network resources and provides services

Example: Windows Server, Novell NetWare

Use Case: File sharing, printer sharing in offices

6. Mobile OS
Purpose: Optimized for mobile devices with touch interfaces

Example: Android, iOS

Use Case: Smartphones, tablets

Key Interview Points to Remember
When asked "What is an Operating System?" you can say:

"An OS is system software that manages computer hardware and provides a platform for application programs to run. It acts as an intermediary between users and hardware, handling key functions like process management, memory allocation, file handling, and device control."

For "Why do we need an Operating System?"

"Without an OS, users would need to manually manage all hardware resources, which is impractical. The OS simplifies computer usage by abstracting hardware complexity and providing a user-friendly interface."

Common OS Examples to Mention:

Desktop: Windows, macOS, Linux

Mobile: Android, iOS

Server: Windows Server, Linux distributions

Real-Time: VxWorks, FreeRTOS
