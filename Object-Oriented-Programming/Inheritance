/*
Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (child class) acquires the properties and behaviors (methods and fields) of an existing class (parent class).

In simple terms: It's like a child inheriting traits from a parent. The child can have all the parent's features and also have its own unique features.

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");

}

// Child class (also called subclass)
// Dog INHERITS from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Dog automatically has the eat() method from Animal

    // Dog's own unique method

        System.out.println("Woof! Woof!");

        // Output:
        // This animal eats food.
