/*
CPU scheduling is the process by which the operating system decides which process runs on the CPU when multiple processes are ready. The scheduler selects from ready processes and allocates the CPU.

1. FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
Concept: Processes are executed in the order they arrive

Type: Non-preemptive

Advantage: Simple and fair

Disadvantage: Poor performance (convoy effect)

Example:
Processes: P1(24ms), P2(3ms), P3(3ms)
Order: P1 → P2 → P3
Average Wait Time = (0 + 24 + 27)/3 = 17ms

2. SJF (Shortest Job First)
Concept: Process with smallest CPU burst runs first

Type: Can be preemptive or non-preemptive

Advantage: Minimizes average waiting time

Disadvantage: Starvation of long processes

Example:
Processes: P1(6ms), P2(8ms), P3(7ms), P4(3ms)
Order: P4(3) → P1(6) → P3(7) → P2(8)

3. Round Robin (RR)
Concept: Each process gets small time quantum (time slice)

Type: Preemptive

Advantage: Fair to all processes, good for time-sharing

Disadvantage: High overhead with small time quantum

Example:
Time Quantum = 4ms
Processes: P1(24), P2(3), P3(3)
Execution: P1(4) → P2(3) → P3(3) → P1(4) → ...

4. Priority Scheduling (PS)
Concept: Each process has priority; higher priority runs first

Type: Preemptive or non-preemptive

Advantage: Important processes get attention

Disadvantage: Starvation of low-priority processes

Example:
Processes: P1(prio=3), P2(prio=1), P3(prio=2)
Order: P2(highest priority) → P3 → P1
