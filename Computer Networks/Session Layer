## 🧩 Session Layer (Layer 5 of the OSI Model)

### 📘 Overview
The **Session Layer** is the **fifth layer** of the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model.  
It acts as a bridge between the **Transport Layer (Layer 4)** and the **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**.  
Its main purpose is to **establish, manage, and terminate sessions** between two communicating systems or applications.

### ⚙️ Key Functions

1. **Session Establishment, Maintenance, and Termination**  
   - Starts, maintains, and ends communication sessions between two hosts.  
   - Ensures that both systems are synchronized for reliable data exchange.

2. **Dialog Control**  
   - Determines which side can transmit data at a given time (half-duplex or full-duplex communication).  

3. **Synchronization**  
   - Adds checkpoints (synchronization points) during data transmission so that if a failure occurs, communication can resume from the last checkpoint instead of restarting completely.

4. **Session Recovery**  
   - Recovers data lost during transmission and resumes disrupted sessions without retransmitting everything.

### 🧠 Examples

- **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**  
- **NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System)**  
- **PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)**

### 🖥️ Real-World Analogy
Imagine the Session Layer as a **moderator in a video conference**:
- 🎬 Starts the call (session establishment)  
- 🗣️ Ensures participants take turns speaking (dialog control)  
- 🔚 Ends the meeting properly (session termination)

### 🧩 Layer Relationship

| OSI Layer | Layer Number | Main Role |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| 🪶 Presentation | 6 | Data translation, encryption, compression |
| 🧩 **Session** | **5** | **Session management and control** |
| 🚚 Transport | 4 | Reliable data delivery (TCP/UDP) |

### 📚 Summary

- **Layer Number:** 5  
- **Main Function:** Manages communication sessions between applications  
- **Keywords:** Synchronization, Dialog Control, Session Recovery  
- **Examples:** RPC, NetBIOS, PPTP
