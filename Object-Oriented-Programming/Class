/*
What is a class in OOP?

A class is like a blueprint for creating objects.

It defines properties (variables / attributes) and behaviors (methods / functions).

An object is an actual instance of a class.

Think of a class as a "plan" for a house, and an object as the "house" built from that plan.

// Defining a class
class Car {
    // Properties (Attributes)
    String brand;
    int year;

    // Constructor (used to initialize objects)
    Car(String brand, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method (Behavior)
    void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + brand + ", Year: " + year);
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating objects (instances of Car class)
        Car car1 = new Car("Tesla", 2022);
        Car car2 = new Car("Toyota", 2020);

        // Calling methods on objects
        car1.displayInfo();
        car2.displayInfo();
    }
}
