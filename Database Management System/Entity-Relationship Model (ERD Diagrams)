/*
An ERD is a visual diagram that describes the structure of a database. It shows the main elements:

Entities: The "things" or objects we want to store data about (e.g., Student, Course). Represented by rectangles.

Attributes: The properties or details of an entity (e.g., Student_ID, Student_Name). Represented by ovals.

Relationships: How two or more entities are connected to each other (e.g., A Student enrolls in a Course). Represented by diamonds.

In simple terms: It's like a blueprint for your data before you build the database. It helps you plan the tables and how they link together.

      [Enrolls-In]          (M:N Relationship)
      /          \
     /            \
[Student]       [Course]

-- 1. The Student Entity becomes a table.
CREATE TABLE Student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY, -- PK
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(255)
);

-- 2. The Course Entity becomes a table.
CREATE TABLE Course (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY, -- PK
    title VARCHAR(255),
    credits INT
);

-- 3. The M:N "Enrolls-In" Relationship becomes a new LINKING TABLE.
-- This table solves the M:N problem.
CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    enrollment_date DATE,
    -- The primary key is the combination of both foreign keys
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),
    -- These are Foreign Keys (FK) that create the links
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Student(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES Course(course_id)
);
